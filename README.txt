19-1. Blog: Start a new Django project called Blog. Create an app called 
blogs, with one model that represents an overall blog, and one model that rep
resents an individual blog post. Give each model an appropriate set of fields. 
Create a superuser for the project, and use the admin site to make a blog and 
a couple of short posts. Make a home page that shows all posts in an appropri
ate order.
Create pages for making a blog, for making new posts, and for editing 
existing posts. Use your pages to make sure they work.

19-2. Blog Accounts: Add a user authentication and registration system to the 
Blog project you started in Exercise 19-1 (page 415). Make sure logged-in users 
see their username somewhere on the screen and unregistered users see a link 
to the registration page.
